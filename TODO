To do:

- std::function and std::bind for function callback in HL2udp.cpp

- Restructure some classes/code to have better (some!) class inheritance to avoid duplicated udp code

- Disable TX in the 2nd HL2/send 0's in the packet.

- Take the maximum temperature of any hl2, take an ADC bit

- ADC selection in PC from packet

- Open up TX/phasing for both HL2s

- Main server threads don't have any method to stop them
